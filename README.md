**Project Introduction:**
The project mainly focuses on the impact caused by different measures taken by different countries to control the spread of Covid-19. 
We have a dataset of around 22k records of measures taken by different countries along with the dates they started implementing these measures. 
We'll augment this dataset with the dataset of the number of Covid cases in each country each day. 
Our aim is to analyze the rise/fall in the number of Covid-19 cases before and after taking the necessary measures.

**Research Question:**

 - How did the different measures taken by different countries to
   control the Pandemic impact the total number of Covid-19 cases?
